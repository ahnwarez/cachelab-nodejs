# About

This is my attempt solving cachelab from the book Computer System's: A programmers Perspective. The solution is implemented in nodejs.

To run the code:

```sh
# -s number of set index bits
# -E number of Lines
# -b number of block offset bits
node index.js -s 4 -E 1 -b 4 ./traces/yi2.trace
```
